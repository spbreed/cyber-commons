"""Headless proof that the controls do what the lessons say they do.

No server, no model, no network. It exercises the identity and delegation path
directly, which is the half that has to hold whatever the model decides.

    python -m cybertravels.tests.smoke_test

Each case is written as an assertion about a *refusal*, because that is the
side that is easy to get wrong and impossible to notice: a system that lets
everything through passes every happy-path test ever written.
