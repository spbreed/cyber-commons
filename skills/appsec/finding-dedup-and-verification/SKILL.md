# Findings are not defects, and some of them are not real

A pipeline running three analyses over one file produces findings that overlap
in two different ways — the same defect reported under an alias, and the same
defect reported by three tools — and, if a model is one of the tools, findings
about symbols that do not exist. Both have to be resolved before a human sees
the list, or the human resolves them by ignoring the list.

## When to use this

Between analysis and triage, in any pipeline with more than one analyser, and
always when a model is one of them.

## Procedure

**1 — Normalise the CWE.** Maintain an alias map — CWE-943 is CWE-89 for this
purpose — and normalise before comparing. Aliases are why the same defect
appears twice with different identifiers.

**2 — Key each finding by defect, not by report.** File, enclosing function,
normalised CWE. Line numbers move; the enclosing function does not, and it is
what makes two reports of one defect collapse.

**3 — When duplicates disagree, keep the one with the best evidence.** A taint
result carries a path; a grep hit carries a line; a model result carries a
sentence. Prefer in that order, and record which tools agreed — agreement is
useful signal even though it is not proof.

**4 — Verify each survivor against the source.** Does the symbol it names appear
in the file? Is the module it blames imported? A finding about `os.system` in a
file that never imports `os` is a hallucination, and it is rejected here rather
than in a maintainer's inbox.

**5 — Report both counts and the rejects.** Raw findings, distinct defects, and
the rejected list with the reason. Discarding hallucinations silently loses the
measurement of how often the analyser produces them.

## Example

**Input** — the queue at the top of
[`scripts/finding_dedup_and_verification.py`](scripts/finding_dedup_and_verification.py),
verified against `cybertravels/tools/bookings_api.py` read off disk. The line
numbers are real line numbers in that file: the CWE-89 is where Semgrep put it,
and the CWE-639 is the hypothesis B2.3's model pass emitted on `get_booking`.
Edit the queue and re-run — the buckets, counts and verdicts are derived from
it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
8 raw findings from 3 tracks, against tools/bookings_api.py
   grep  CWE-89   tools/bookings_api.py:41 execute       conf=0.50
   taint CWE-89   tools/bookings_api.py:41 execute       conf=1.00
   model CWE-89   tools/bookings_api.py:42 execute       conf=0.93
   model CWE-943  tools/bookings_api.py:41 execute       conf=0.71
   model CWE-639  tools/bookings_api.py:20 get_booking   conf=0.82
   model CWE-89   tools/bookings_api.py:47 execute       conf=0.44
   model CWE-798  tools/bookings_api.py:8  DB_PASSWORD   conf=0.88
   model CWE-78   tools/bookings_api.py:34 os.system     conf=0.67
```

Eight become five, then three. Two of the three are real, and the third — a
CWE-89 on `list_my_bookings`, whose query is parameterised — is not. Neither
stage rejects it, and neither is supposed to: these two remove what is provably
duplicated and provably absent. Judging a claim about code that exists is
triage, and it is a later stage.

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "raw": 0,
  "defects": [{"key": "str", "file": "str", "function": "str", "cwe": "str",
               "reported_by": ["str"], "kept_from": "str"}],
  "rejected": [{"finding": "str", "reason": "symbol absent|module not imported"}],
  "counts": {"raw": 0, "distinct": 0, "rejected": 0}
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Keying on the line number.** One edit and the same defect is two.
- **Merging by CWE alone.** Two real SQL injections in one file are two defects.
- **Dropping hallucinations without counting them.** That count is how you know
  whether to keep the analyser.
