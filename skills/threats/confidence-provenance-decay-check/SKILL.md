# Confidence rises at exactly the rate evidence disappears

"I could not find a CVE, it is probably fine" becomes "libfoo is clean" in
three hops. Nothing in the chain lied. Each step did what summarising does —
dropped the hedge, dropped the caveat, dropped the sentence saying where the
claim came from — and the result is a confident statement with no evidence
behind it.

## When to use this

Report generation, triage pipelines, research chains, any agent that consumes
another agent's output, and any workflow where a human reads only the last
artefact.

## Procedure

**1 — Find the chains.** Every place where generated text is input to a later
generation step. Include the human-visible summary at the end; it is a hop.

**2 — Instrument the original claim.** Record its hedge, its confidence if one
is stated, and its provenance — the source it rests on.

**3 — Step the chain and record both series.** After each hop, the claim's
confidence and its surviving provenance fields. Two numbers per hop; the shape
is the finding.

**4 — Identify the hop where provenance empties.** That is where the claim
became unfalsifiable, and it is almost always earlier than where the confidence
peaked.

**5 — Test the carry rule.** A chain that propagates confidence and provenance
as structured fields, rather than as prose the next step must re-read, does not
decay this way. Check whether the interface has those fields at all.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/confidence_provenance_decay_check.py`](scripts/confidence_provenance_decay_check.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
 hop   confidence  claim
   0         0.20  I could not find a CVE for libfoo, it is probably fine
   1         0.80  a CVE for libfoo, it is fine
   2         0.80  a CVE for libfoo, it is fine
   3         0.80  a CVE for libfoo, it is fine

provenance recorded at hop 3: none
confidence at hop 0: 0.20   at hop 3: 0.8
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "chain": [{"hop": 0, "claim": "str", "confidence": 0.0, "provenance": ["str"]}],
  "confidence_delta": 0.0,
  "provenance_lost_at": 0,
  "interface": {"carries_confidence": false, "carries_provenance": false},
  "human_reads_hop": 0
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Judging the final claim on its own.** It reads well. That is the problem.
- **Measuring only confidence.** The pair is the finding; either alone is
  ordinary.
- **Fixing it with a prompt.** "Preserve caveats" is advisory; a field is not.
