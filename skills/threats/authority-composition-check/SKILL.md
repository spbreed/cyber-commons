description: >-
  Check whether a scope a user is denied directly can be reached through a chain
  of individually legitimate hops, and whether an agent's restatement of a claim
  carries more weight than a colleague's. Use when reviewing an orchestrator, a
  routing layer, or an agent that answers on behalf of people.

# Every hop legitimate, the composition unauthorised

A user is denied `payments:write` at the front door and reaches it through the
orchestrator. No hop broke a rule. Authorisation was decided per edge, and
nobody owns the path. The second half of the check is social: the same claim is
believed more when an agent states it, which is what makes an agent a good
carrier for one.

## When to use this

Any system where a request is routed, decomposed, or delegated between
components with different privileges — an orchestrator, a workflow engine, a
tool that calls another tool.

## Procedure

**1 — Draw the edges with their scopes.** For each hop, what identity it runs
as and what it may do. The picture is usually the first time anyone has seen
the composition.

**2 — Attempt the direct call and record the refusal.** Establish that the
control exists, so the composed success is a finding rather than a
misunderstanding.

**3 — Compose a path to the same effect.** Ask for something the orchestrator
will decompose into the denied action. Record each hop's decision: every one
should be a legitimate "yes".

**4 — Find where the path could have been evaluated.** Usually nowhere: each
component sees one edge. Name the component that would have to hold the
end-to-end policy, because that is the fix.

**5 — Test the trust asymmetry.** Present the same unverified claim from an
agent and from a person, and record which is challenged. If the agent's version
is accepted more readily, the agent is the better delivery vehicle and that
belongs in the report.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/authority_composition_check.py`](scripts/authority_composition_check.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
mallory holds        : ['reports:read']
mallory asks directly for payments:write -> DENIED

same outcome, requested through the architecture:
   user asks orchestrator    mallory         ok
   orchestrator routes       orchestrator    ok
   agent acts                finance-agent   ok
   -> reached payments:write: True
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "edges": [{"from": "str", "to": "str", "runs_as": "str", "scopes": ["str"]}],
  "direct": {"scope": "str", "refused": true},
  "composed": {"path": ["str"], "each_hop_legitimate": true, "effect_achieved": true},
  "policy_owner": {"component": "str", "exists": false},
  "trust_asymmetry": {"agent_claim_challenged": false, "human_claim_challenged": true}
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Auditing hops.** They are all fine; that is the point.
- **Skipping the direct refusal.** Without it the composed success looks like
  intended behaviour.
- **Leaving the trust asymmetry out** because it is not technical. It is the
  reason the finding recurs.
