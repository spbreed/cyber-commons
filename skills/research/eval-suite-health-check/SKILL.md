# A suite that gets easier reports that you got better

An evaluation suite is an instrument, and instruments drift. Two properties keep
it honest: a control should move the surface it addresses and leave the others
alone, and the aggregate should not improve because somebody added cases
everything already blocks.

## When to use this

Whenever an eval number moves, before adding cases to a suite, and at any
regular review of a safety benchmark you rely on.

## Procedure

**1 — Run the baseline with intervals.** Per case and per surface. A point
estimate cannot support the comparison you are about to make.

**2 — Apply one control and re-run.** The prediction is specific: the surface it
addresses drops, with non-overlapping intervals, and the other surfaces do not
move. Both halves are the test — a control that moves everything is measuring
something other than the control.

**3 — Report per surface, never only in aggregate.** The aggregate hides both a
control that works and a control that broke something else.

**4 — Dilute the suite deliberately.** Add cases the target trivially blocks and
re-compute. Watch the aggregate improve while nothing about the system changed.
That demonstration is what justifies the next step.

**5 — Add a suite-health check.** Difficulty distribution, share of cases no
target has ever failed, and the date each case was added. A suite with a growing
share of trivial cases is reporting improvement it has not earned.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/eval_suite_health_check.py`](scripts/eval_suite_health_check.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
case    surface         rate              ci95
------------------------------------------------
INJ-01  injection      0.055    (0.033, 0.077)
INJ-02  injection      0.355    (0.308, 0.402)
INJ-03  injection      0.657    (0.611, 0.704)
INJ-04  injection      0.725    (0.681, 0.769)
IDN-01  identity       0.000        (0.0, 0.0)
IDN-02  identity       0.953    (0.932, 0.973)
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "baseline": [{"case": "str", "surface": "str", "rate": 0.0, "interval": [0.0, 0.0]}],
  "with_control": [{"surface": "str", "rate": 0.0, "interval": [0.0, 0.0], "moved": true}],
  "expected_unchanged": ["str"],
  "dilution": {"added_trivial": 0, "aggregate_before": 0.0, "aggregate_after": 0.0},
  "health": {"trivial_share": 0.0, "never_failed": 0, "oldest_case": "str"}
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Aggregate-only reporting.** It hides the two things you are looking for.
- **A control that moves every surface.** Investigate before celebrating.
- **Adding cases without recording difficulty.** The suite drifts easier and the
  score drifts up.
