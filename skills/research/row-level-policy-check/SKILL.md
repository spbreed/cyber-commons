name: row-level-policy-check
description: >-
  Query an exposed data API as an anonymous caller with row-level security off
  and on, and count what a publishable key returns. Use when a client-side key
  reaches a database directly, or when a platform's default is open until
  somebody closes it.

# The anonymous key is meant to be public; the rows are not

Platforms that expose a database over HTTP hand out a key designed to ship in a
client. That is safe exactly when row-level policy is on, and the default on
several of them is off. The check is one query, run twice, and it is the
difference between a key that is public by design and a table that is.

## When to use this

Any deployment where a browser or an agent talks to a database service directly,
and any platform whose quickstart hands you an anonymous key.

## Procedure

**1 — Get the publishable key from where it actually is.** The client bundle,
the mobile app, the agent's configuration. It is not a secret and treating it as
one is what hides this defect.

**2 — Enumerate the tables.** Use the platform's catalogue rather than the
application's own queries — the application only touches the tables it needs,
which is not the set that exists.

**3 — Query each table anonymously with policy off.** Record the row count and,
specifically, whether any row contains a credential: provider keys stored
alongside agent configuration are the common and expensive case.

**4 — Enable policy and re-run.** Anonymous should return nothing; a signed-in
owner should return their own rows and no more. Both halves — a policy that
returns nothing to everyone is an outage.

**5 — Cost the exposure.** For every credential returned, name the provider and
who can revoke it. The revocation owner is usually not you, and that is the
sentence that gets the work scheduled.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "key": {"kind": "publishable", "found_in": "str"},
  "tables": [{"name": "str", "sensitive": true,
              "anon_rows_policy_off": 0, "anon_rows_policy_on": 0, "owner_rows": 0}],
  "credentials_exposed": [{"provider": "str", "revocable_by": "str"}],
  "verdict": "open|closed"
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Testing with the service key.** It bypasses policy; that proves nothing.
- **Enumerating from the application.** It knows about its own tables only.
- **Reporting rows without the credentials.** The provider keys are the
  incident.
