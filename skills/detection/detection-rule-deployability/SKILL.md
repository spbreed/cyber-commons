  Score candidate detection rules on precision, recall and firing volume, and

  when authoring detections with or without a model, or when a rule is proposed

# A rule that fires 301 times for one true positive is not a detection

Every candidate rule detects something. Deployability is a different property
and it is arithmetic: precision, recall, and how many times the rule fires per
day against real history. A rule failing on the third is rejected however good
the first two look, because it will be muted within a week.

## When to use this

Authoring detections, reviewing a model's proposed rules, and any time a rule is
proposed on the strength of catching one incident.

## Procedure

**1 — Replay each candidate against real history.** Not a sample chosen to
contain the incident — the actual period, including the quiet parts.

**2 — Compute precision, recall and volume.** Volume is the one people omit and
the one that decides whether the rule survives contact with an analyst.

**3 — Set a deployability bar before you look at the results.** Precision floor,
recall floor, and a maximum firings per day. Setting it afterwards means setting
it around the rule you like.

**4 — Reject the broad rules explicitly, with their numbers.** "Rejected: 301
firings for 1 true positive" is a sentence the author can act on; "too noisy" is
not.

**5 — Look at what survived, and what it depends on.** A high-precision rule
usually depends on a specific field being populated. Record that dependency —
it is the thing that will silently break the rule later.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/detection_rule_deployability.py`](scripts/detection_rule_deployability.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
history: 522 events, 2 true positives
rule                                 alerts   prec  recall  alerts/TP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
R1 any http_get by an agent             301  0.003   0.500      301.0
R2 http_get to a non-github host          1  1.000   0.500        1.0
R3 link-local address                     1  1.000   0.500        1.0
R4 any failed action                     20  0.000   0.000        inf
R5 credential path OR link-local          2  1.000   1.000        1.0
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "history": {"events": 0, "period_days": 0, "true_positives": 0},
  "candidates": [{"name": "str", "fires": 0, "tp": 0, "precision": 0.0, "recall": 0.0,
                  "per_day": 0.0, "verdict": "deploy|reject", "why": "str"}],
  "bar": {"precision": 0.0, "recall": 0.0, "max_per_day": 0},
  "dependencies": [{"rule": "str", "requires_field": "str"}]
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Replaying against a period chosen to contain the incident.** Volume becomes
  meaningless.
- **Setting the bar after seeing the results.** That is choosing a winner.
- **Deploying a rule with an unrecorded field dependency.** It fails silently
  when the field stops being populated.
