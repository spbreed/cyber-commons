# Coverage is a column, not a percentage

Every estate that runs agents already owns four classes of sensor, bought for
people and hosts. The question is not whether they work — they do, at what they
were built for — but which parts of an agent's working day are inside their
field of view at all.

Answer it as a matrix and one number falls out that no product page will give
you: the actions seen by **nothing**.

## When to use this

Before a detection roadmap, before a tooling purchase, and any time "we already
have visibility" is offered as an answer about an agent estate.

## Procedure

**1 — List the sensor classes you own, with the product behind each.** Naming
the product keeps the conversation checkable. The open-source references are
Wazuh for EDR, regex plus file integrity monitoring for the DLP that most teams
actually have, Prowler or ScoutSuite for CSPM, and Falco plus Trivy for CNAPP.

**2 — List what the agents do, not what you fear.** An ordinary day: files
written, an outbound session to a model API, a customer record read through an
internal API, tokens placed in a prompt, a vendor tool called, money moved, a
role assumed, a child process spawned.

**3 — Score each cell as full, partial or none — on visibility, not alerting.**
"Would this sensor alert" is a tuning question and comes later. "Is this sensor
in the path" is a fact about architecture, and it is the one that decides
whether tuning is even possible.

**4 — Read the uncovered rows, and read what they have in common.** If the
uncovered set is arbitrary, tune. If it is coherent — every action inside the
reasoning loop, or behind an API the host never observes — then a fifth product
of the same four kinds will not move it, and the answer is a new source rather
than a better rule.

## Example

```
per-sensor coverage of the agent's day
  EDR     3.0 / 9   33%
  DLP     0.5 / 9   6%
  CSPM    0.5 / 9   6%
  CNAPP   3.0 / 9   33%

  best single sensor   EDR
  all four combined    3.5 / 9   39%
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py`
executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill
actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "sensors": [{"name": "str", "product": "str", "sees": "str"}],
  "actions": [{"action": "str", "coverage": {"EDR": "full|partial|none"}}],
  "per_sensor": [{"name": "str", "score": 0.0, "of": 0}],
  "combined": {"score": 0.0, "of": 0},
  "uncovered": ["str"]
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Scoring alerting rather than visibility.** A sensor that is not in the path
  cannot be tuned into one that is.
- **Summing the columns.** Four sensors covering the same three actions is
  still three actions; take the union per row, which is what the script does.
- **Reporting the combined percentage alone.** 39% sounds like a tuning problem.
  The four named rows are the finding.
- **Treating a partial as a full.** Seeing a TLS session open is not seeing what
  crossed it.
