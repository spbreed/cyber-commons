  Scan an agent's run record for sensitive content it read legitimately, then

# The agent read a card number because you asked it to

An agent run record is the richest telemetry in the estate and the most
dangerous to keep whole. The content it read — source files, tickets, documents
— lands in the record, so the record inherits every classification the source
had. Per-record retention forces a choice between losing the investigation and
keeping the data; per-field does not.

## When to use this

Before agent telemetry is retained at scale, and whenever a retention policy is
being written by someone who has not read a run record.

## Procedure

**1 — Read one full record.** Every step, every field. This is the step people
skip, and it is where the payment-card pattern in a legitimately-read source
file turns up.

**2 — Scan for sensitive patterns across all fields.** Card numbers, keys,
personal data, health terms. Record which field carried each hit — prompts and
tool results are the usual answer.

**3 — Classify fields by investigative value.** Timestamps, tool name, target
and verifier verdict answer most investigation questions. Prompts and raw tool
output answer few and carry most of the risk.

**4 — Set retention per field.** Long for the structural fields, short for the
content ones. Then age a record and check what an investigation could still do
with it — that check is what makes the policy defensible.

**5 — State what is lost.** A short prompt retention means you cannot re-derive
motivation after that window. Say so, rather than discovering it in an incident.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/agent_telemetry_retention.py`](scripts/agent_telemetry_retention.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
full record (everything the harness saw):
    {'n': 1, 'tool': 'read_file', 'target': '/work/repo/billing.py', 'verifier': 'n/a', 'ok': True, 'prompt': 'Investigate finding SEC-4471 in billing.py', 'result': 'def charge(card_number, amount):  # card_number = 4111111111111111'}
    {'n': 2, 'tool': 'search_code', 'target': 'charge(', 'verifier': 'n/a', 'ok': True, 'prompt': 'find callers of charge()', 'result': 'api/checkout.py:88 charge(user.card, total)'}
    {'n': 3, 'tool': 'write_file', 'target': '/work/repo/billing.py', 'verifier': 'tests pass', 'ok': True, 'prompt': 'apply the fix', 'result': 'patch applied'}
sensitive content found in the trace:
   step 1  result   payment card

Nobody put a card number in the trace deliberately. The agent read a
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "record": {"steps": 0, "fields": ["str"]},
  "scan": [{"pattern": "str", "field": "str", "legitimate_source": "str"}],
  "retention": [{"field": "str", "days": 0, "investigative_value": "high|low"}],
  "aged_record": {"age_days": 0, "questions_still_answerable": ["str"], "lost": ["str"]}
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Retaining or discarding whole records.** Both answers are wrong.
- **Scanning prompts only.** Tool results carry the same content.
- **Not stating what the short windows lose.** That is the trade being made.
