  Write detections whose subject is the agent platform itself — sandbox escape,

# A generic anomaly score gives an escape sequence 0.07

An escape from an agent sandbox is seven quiet events. It does not look like
volume, it does not look like a spike, and a generic anomaly detector ranks it
near zero. Detections whose subject is the platform are specific by necessity,
and each of them names a mechanism rather than a statistic.

## When to use this

Any estate running agent workloads on shared infrastructure, and after any
incident where "we would have seen it" was asserted without a named rule.

## Procedure

**1 — Enumerate the platform's own failure modes.** Escape from the sandbox,
processes that outlive their tool call, artefact cache contents changing between
runs, credentials appearing in output, tools invoked outside the manifest.

**2 — Write one named rule per mechanism.** Each with the specific condition it
matches — a process tree deviating from the baseline, a PID alive after its call
returned, a manifest hash mismatch. Named rules can be argued with; scores
cannot.

**3 — Run them against a real sequence.** All the rules that should fire, should.
Record which fired and on which event, because that mapping is what an analyst
uses to reconstruct.

**4 — Score the same sequence with a generic anomaly detector.** Report both
numbers side by side. The comparison is the argument for writing platform
detections at all.

**5 — Check each rule's data dependency.** A cache-diff rule needs a manifest; an
orphan rule needs process accounting. A rule whose input is not collected is a
plan.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "mechanisms": ["str"],
  "rules": [{"name": "str", "condition": "str", "requires": "str"}],
  "sequence": [{"event": "str", "rules_fired": ["str"]}],
  "generic_anomaly": {"score": 0.0},
  "coverage": {"fired": 0, "expected": 0, "missing_inputs": ["str"]}
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Relying on a generic anomaly detector.** The sequence is quiet by
  construction.
- **Rules whose inputs nobody collects.** Check the pipeline, not the rule.
- **One rule for "escape".** Escape is several mechanisms with different
  evidence.
