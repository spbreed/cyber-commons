# Input Injection Screening Verifier

**Controls:** Control 5 — indirect prompt-injection screening

## Confidence: PARTIAL — and this ceiling is not negotiable

You can verify that a detector **exists on the path** and record its class.
You cannot verify that it works. Published defences that reduce attack success
to a few percent under static attacks have been driven back above 95% by
adaptive, search-based attacks, and human red-teamers defeat them routinely.

**Record the detector class. Do not assert protection. Cap at PARTIAL.**

## When to use this
When a deployment claims to screen untrusted input, and specifically when
somebody wants that claim recorded as PASS. It cannot be: the ceiling here is
PARTIAL and not negotiable, and running this is how that gets written into the
artefact rather than argued about in a review.

## Procedure

1. **Inventory untrusted ingestion paths.** Email, documents, web fetches,
   tickets, tool results, MCP tool descriptions, retrieved corpora, memory
   reads, inter-agent messages. Anything a party outside your trust boundary
   can write into.

2. **For each path, determine whether a screening step exists** between
   ingestion and model context, and record which one — a classifier, a
   prompt-attack filter, delimiting or spotlighting, a dual-model pattern, or
   nothing.

3. **Check provenance tagging.** Whether the origin survives into the context
   window is more durable than any detector, because it does not depend on
   recognising the payload.

4. **Flag the dangerous combination.** Private data reachable **and** untrusted
   content ingested **and** an egress path available is the combination that
   turns injection into exfiltration. Any deployment with all three is a
   finding on its own, whatever the detector says.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/input_injection_screening_verifier.py`](scripts/input_injection_screening_verifier.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
the same payload, through every ingress component:
   knowledge  -> refused   (knowledge may not select a tool)
   memory     -> refused   (memory may not select a tool)
   mcp        -> refused   (mcp may not select a tool)
   tools      -> refused   (tools may not select a tool)
   messaging  -> refused   (messaging may not select a tool)

rewriting the payload does not help - the check never reads it:
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "deployment_id": "str",
  "ingestion_paths": [
    {"source": "str", "screened": true, "detector_class": "classifier|filter|spotlighting|dual_model|none",
     "provenance_tagged": true}
  ],
  "unscreened_sources": ["str"],
  "trifecta": {"private_data": true, "untrusted_content": true, "egress": true, "present": true},
  "verdict": "PARTIAL|FAIL",
  "verdict_ceiling_reason": "detector presence is verifiable; robustness under adaptive attack is not"
}
```

`PASS` is not a permitted value.

## Failure modes

- **Reporting a detector's benchmark score as this deployment's protection.**
  Those numbers are from static attacks.
- **Missing tool results as an ingestion path.** They are the most commonly
  forgotten one, because they arrive from a system you trust.
- **Ignoring the combination check** because each element looked acceptable
  alone.
