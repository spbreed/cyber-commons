# Aws Runtime Posture Collector

**Controls:** Controls 1 and 2 — runtime posture

## What this collects

Configuration state, at a point in time, for the network and crypto boundary
around one deployment. It is evidence for other skills' verdicts rather than a
verdict in itself.

## When to use this
When an attestation needs to say something about the network, and therefore
after the deployment is running. The claims it supports — default-deny egress,
private endpoints, log retention — are runtime facts that no static analysis
can reach, and re-collecting is what makes the attestation re-issuable when the
posture drifts.

## Procedure

1. **Security groups and network ACLs.** Enumerate egress rules. Any rule
   permitting `0.0.0.0/0` outbound is an egress-open finding regardless of what
   an application-layer policy says.
2. **Private endpoints.** Record whether a private endpoint exists for each
   model and gateway service in use, and read the endpoint policy — an
   unscoped endpoint policy is an endpoint that permits any principal.
3. **Route tables.** Identify NAT and internet gateways on the deployment's
   subnets. A private endpoint does not help if a default route to an internet
   gateway remains.
4. **Key policies.** Record key policies and condition keys that scope use to a
   specific service. Unconditioned key access is a finding.
5. **Logging.** Confirm the audit trail and log destinations are enabled and
   delivering, and record the retention.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/aws_runtime_posture_collector.py`](scripts/aws_runtime_posture_collector.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
control  state           age (days)
------------------------------------
AC-1     PASS                   2.0
AC-2     PASS                   9.0
SB-1     STALE                 31.0
SB-2     STALE                120.0
EV-1     PASS                   5.0
EV-2     PASS                  12.0
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "deployment_id": "str",
  "collected_at": "str",
  "network": {
    "egress_open_findings": [{"sg": "str", "rule": "str"}],
    "private_endpoints": [{"service": "str", "present": true, "policy_scoped": true}],
    "internet_route_present": false
  },
  "crypto": {"keys": [{"id": "str", "conditioned": true}]},
  "logging": {"audit_trail_enabled": true, "log_destinations": ["str"], "retention_days": 0},
  "verdict": "PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL"
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Reading configuration and calling it enforcement.** This skill records what
  is configured. Whether traffic actually obeys it is the egress verifier's job.
- **Ignoring the route table** because a private endpoint exists.
- **Recording that logging is enabled** without checking that it is delivering.
