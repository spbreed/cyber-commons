# The clock started before you knew what happened

Disclosure deadlines run from awareness, and awareness is a defensible judgement
rather than a timestamp. The same incident is met or missed depending on which
point you treat as the start — and the delay that misses it is almost never
containment. It is scoping, and broken attribution is what makes scoping slow.

## When to use this

Any incident with a reporting obligation, and in advance as a tabletop, which is
the only time the answer can still be changed.

## Procedure

**1 — List the candidate awareness points.** First alert, first triage, first
confirmation, first executive notification. Each is arguable, and the earliest
defensible one is the one to plan against.

**2 — Run the clock from each.** Containment, scoping, report drafted, report
submitted. Record met or missed per obligation, per starting point.

**3 — Find the term that misses the deadline.** Containment in an hour and
scoping in three days still misses a 72-hour obligation. Attribution that cannot
say which principal acted turns scoping from hours into days.

**4 — Map obligations to jurisdictions and their clocks.** Different regimes,
different windows, different definitions of a reportable event. One incident can
be inside one and outside another.

**5 — Name an owner per step in the runbook.** Containment, scoping, disclosure
drafting, submission. A runbook with an unowned step is where the hours go.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/regulatory_clock_check.py`](scripts/regulatory_clock_check.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
scenario                            contain   report   met   margin
--------------------------------------------------------------------
fast containment, slow scoping          1.0     80.0 False     -8.0
slow containment, fast reporting       40.0     60.0  True     12.0
both fast                               2.0     20.0  True     52.0
attribution broken (D2.1)               6.0     92.0 False    -20.0

The first row contained in ONE HOUR and still missed the deadline.
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "awareness_points": [{"name": "str", "at": "str", "defensible": true}],
  "obligations": [{"regime": "str", "hours": 0}],
  "runs": [{"from": "str", "containment_h": 0, "scoping_h": 0, "report_h": 0,
            "met": [{"regime": "str", "met": false, "by_hours": 0}]}],
  "dominant_delay": "str",
  "runbook": [{"step": "str", "owner": "str|null"}]
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Starting the clock at confirmation.** A regulator may start it earlier.
- **Optimising containment.** Scoping is the term that misses the deadline.
- **An unowned runbook step.** It is the one that takes a day.
