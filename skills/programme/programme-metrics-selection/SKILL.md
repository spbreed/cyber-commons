  separate them from the comfortable ones that stay green regardless. Use when

# A metric that cannot go red is a decoration

The test for a programme metric is simple and rarely applied: if the programme
were neglected for a quarter, would this number move? Counts of policies
published, training completed and tools deployed would not. Exposure,
containment effectiveness, evidence freshness and measured time-to-stop all
would.

## When to use this

Choosing what to report to an executive committee, and auditing an existing
dashboard that is entirely green.

## Procedure

**1 — List the candidate metrics** and, for each, what it is computed from.
Anything computed from a plan rather than from the estate is a decoration
already.

**2 — Apply the neglect test.** Simulate a quarter with nothing done: no
attestations refreshed, no evals run, no drift reviewed. Which numbers move?

**3 — Keep the ones that move and say what each one costs to compute.** A
metric nobody can produce monthly will be produced annually and stop being a
control.

**4 — Report the comfortable ones you are dropping,** with the reason. They have
constituencies, and removing them silently gets them reinstated.

**5 — Set a target and a direction per surviving metric.** A number with no
target is a chart; a number with a target is a commitment somebody is
accountable for.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/programme_metrics_selection.py`](scripts/programme_metrics_selection.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
exposure   fleet blast radius             46   units of unreviewed action
likelihood red-team ASR                  25%   measured, containment surface
assurance  controls evidenced            50%   4/8
coverage   agents in inventory           34%   41 of ~120 est.
speed      measured time-to-stop         12s   game day 41 days ago
metrics that look like governance and are not:
   findings closed this quarter      goes up with activity; says nothing about posture
   training completion %             reaches 98% and stays there forever
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "candidates": [{"name": "str", "computed_from": "estate|plan", "moves_under_neglect": false}],
  "kept": [{"name": "str", "value": 0.0, "target": 0.0, "cadence": "str", "cost": "str"}],
  "dropped": [{"name": "str", "why": "str"}],
  "neglect_simulation": {"quarter": "str", "moved": ["str"], "unmoved": ["str"]}
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Metrics computed from the plan.** They measure the plan.
- **Dropping comfortable metrics silently.** They come back.
- **No target.** Nobody is accountable for a direction.
