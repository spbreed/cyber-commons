description: >-
  Trace each joint runbook from the function that owns it to the function that
  consumes it, and find the handoffs that were agreed and never actually
  delivered. Use when two teams both believe the other has something.

# Agreed, documented, never delivered

A joint runbook has an owner and a consumer, and closing the seam between two
functions means the consumer actually receives the artefact. The common failure
is that everyone agrees the handoff exists, the runbook says so, and nothing has
ever been sent — which is invisible until somebody asks the consumer.

## When to use this

After designing cross-functional runbooks, and periodically — this decays.

## Procedure

**1 — List the joint runbooks.** For each: the owning function, the consuming
function, the artefact, and the trigger that should produce it.

**2 — Ask the consumer, not the owner.** "Have you received this, and when?"
Owners report intent accurately and delivery optimistically. The consumer's
answer is the measurement.

**3 — Record the consequence of each undelivered handoff.** Model risk never
receiving the privacy assessment means the tier is computed without a data
input. Name the specific consequence, not "reduced coverage".

**4 — Check the trigger, not the document.** A handoff triggered by a person
remembering is not a handoff. Look for the mechanism: a ticket transition, a
pipeline step, a scheduled export.

**5 — Close by making the trigger automatic or naming a date.** Anything else
recreates the same state, and the check will find it again next time.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "runbooks": [{"name": "str", "owner": "str", "consumer": "str", "artefact": "str",
                "trigger": "str", "trigger_automatic": false}],
  "delivery": [{"runbook": "str", "consumer_confirms": false, "last_received": "str|null"}],
  "undelivered": [{"runbook": "str", "consequence": "str"}],
  "closure": [{"runbook": "str", "action": "automate|scheduled", "due": "str"}]
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Asking the owner.** They will describe the design.
- **Accepting the runbook as evidence.** It is the agreement, not the delivery.
- **A human-memory trigger.** It works until the person changes role.
