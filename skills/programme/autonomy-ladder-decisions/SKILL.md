# Govern the rung, not the tool

Approving tools one at a time produces an agent nobody approved: each tool was
reasonable, and the combination acts unattended on production. Governing the
**rung** asks a different question — what does this agent's blast radius and
gating support — and the answer is computed rather than negotiated.

## When to use this

Every request to raise an agent's autonomy, and as a periodic re-check, because
tools accumulate.

## Procedure

**1 — Publish the ladder.** L1 suggests, L2 acts in a sandbox, L2.5 acts with
approval on irreversible actions, L3 acts unattended. With, for each rung, the
governance and the budget it requires.

**2 — Compute the request's blast radius.** Reachable resources weighted by
scope, with gated actions discounted. Ungated writers are what usually decide
the outcome.

**3 — Derive the supported rung from the radius and the gating,** not from the
requester's ask. Then compare. The gap is the conversation.

**4 — Refuse with the condition attached.** "Refused at L2 for ungated writers"
tells the requester what to change. A bare refusal produces an appeal; a
conditional one produces a pull request.

**5 — Re-evaluate on tool change.** A rung approved with three tools does not
carry over to five. Make the tool manifest the trigger for re-evaluation.

## Example

**Input** — the fixture committed at the top of [`scripts/autonomy_ladder_decisions.py`](scripts/autonomy_ladder_decisions.py). Edit it and re-run: the buckets, counts and verdicts below are derived from it, not hard-coded.

**Output** — the opening lines of a real run:

```
L1   self-service  budget   0  register it; no further review
                   Assist — model proposes, a human performs every action.
L2   lightweight   budget   0  named owner + approval gate on every writer
                   Act with approval — model calls tools, a human approves each call.
L2.5 governed      budget  20  risk tier + blast budget + drift monitoring + tested stop
                   Act within a blast radius — pre-approved tools, bounded scope, review after.
L3   board         budget  60  all of L2.5 + held-out eval per release + board sign-off
                   Autonomous — model acts and self-verifies; humans see aggregates.
```

The run continues past this. The script is the example: `test_skills.py` executes it on every build, so this block cannot drift from what the skill actually prints.

## Output contract

```json
{
  "ladder": [{"rung": "str", "governance": "str", "budget": "str"}],
  "requests": [{"name": "str", "asked": "str", "tools": ["str"], "gated": ["str"],
                "blast": 0, "supported": "str", "verdict": "approved|refused", "condition": "str|null"}],
  "reevaluate_on": ["tool added", "scope widened", "model changed"]
}
```

## Failure modes

- **Approving tools.** The combination is what acts.
- **A bare refusal.** Nobody knows what to fix.
- **No re-evaluation trigger.** The manifest grows and the rung does not move.
