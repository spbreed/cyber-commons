"""Pick the framework that covers the most controls as a spine, and supply the remainder from the others rather than building per-framework.

The procedure this runs is **not in this file**. It is in the `SKILL.md` beside
it, and the model is what carries it out: this script assembles the fixture,
hands the model the skill's own documentation and output contract, and checks
the reply against that same contract.

That is the point. A procedure written in one place and implemented in another
is two things that can disagree, and only one of them runs. Here they are the
same bytes.

The fixture below is committed input, carried over unchanged. Edit it and
re-run — every number in the output is derived from it.

With no endpoint configured this exits 2 and says so. Nothing is substituted
for a model's answer.
