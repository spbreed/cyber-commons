# vulnbench — CyberGym family (execution-based benchmarks)

CyberGym (sunblaze-ucb/cybergym), ExploitGym, and CyberGym-E2E are
**execution-based**: an agent submits a Proof-of-Concept, which is run in Docker
against the vulnerable and patched builds. Success = the PoC crashes the
vulnerable build but not the patched one. They need the cybergym Docker
environment + task data (~130GB+, Python ≥3.12), so they do **not** run on every
host.

## Always start with the preflight (never assume it can run)
```bash
labs/b2.10-eval-harness/scripts/vulnbench.sh cybergym-preflight
```
This honestly reports whether Docker, Python ≥3.12, disk, HuggingFace, and the
image registry are available. If it says the host CANNOT run — report that
plainly; do **not** simulate a score.

## If the host CAN run (preflight passes)
Drive the real cybergym flow (per its README):
1. `git clone https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/cybergym && pip install -e '.[dev,server]'`
2. Download task data (HuggingFace) — full or the 10-task subset.
3. Start the submission server; `python -m cybergym.task.gen_task ... --difficulty level1`.
4. Run an agent that reads the task and submits a PoC via `submit.sh`.
5. Verify: `python scripts/verify_agent_result.py ...` → a results/verify JSONL.

## Score the results (works anywhere, on results produced by the runner)
```bash
labs/b2.10-eval-harness/scripts/vulnbench.sh cybergym-score --results <verify.jsonl> --benchmark cybergym
# --benchmark exploitgym | cybergym-e2e ;  --scoring any-of | final
```
The adapter ([`bench/cybergym_adapter.py`](../../../labs/b2.10-eval-harness/bench/cybergym_adapter.py))
maps the exit-code outcome to Expert Accuracy using CyberGym's own rule
(`vul_exit_code in [0,300]` = no crash; reproduce = crashes vuln, safe on patch).

## Report
Reproduction rate + Expert Accuracy + outcome breakdown. Be explicit whether the
numbers came from a real Docker run (preflight passed) or the adapter scored an
externally-produced results file. Never present the adapter's sample fixture as a
real benchmark result. Full detail: [`docs/CYBERGYM_INTEGRATION.md`](../../../labs/b2.10-eval-harness/docs/CYBERGYM_INTEGRATION.md).
